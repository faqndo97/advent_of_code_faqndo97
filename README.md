# Advent of code

### About

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

### Why?

I just want to do this to practice my ruby skills.

### What can you do?

I would love if you want to review my code and make comments if you don't understand something or if you have a better approach to solve the problems.
